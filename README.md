# choice-primitives

Core primitives for decision-making, optimization, and selection under constraints. This module equips the Spiral architecture with abstractions to represent choices, preferences, utilities, and policies in a domain-agnostic way.

## Purpose

- Model decisions with explicit objectives and constraints
- Support preference aggregation, utility functions, and policy evaluation
- Enable search, optimization, and exploration strategies

## Structure

- Primitives: Choice, Preference, Utility, Policy, ConstraintSet
- Solvers: greedy, dynamic programming, heuristic search, multi-objective
- Composition: sequential choices, concurrent choices, hierarchical policies

## Quick Start - Live 2D Example

This repository includes a fully runnable example demonstrating 2D position optimization with choice primitives.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Constitutional-Solutions/choice-primitives.git
cd choice-primitives
```

### Running the Example

```bash
python example_2d_optimization.py
```

### What the Example Does

The example demonstrates:
- **Choice Class**: Represents options as 2D positions (x, y coordinates)
- **Constraint Set**: Filters positions to stay within a bounding box [0, 10] Ã— [0, 10]
- **Utility Function**: Maximizes distance from origin (0, 0)
- **Optimization Process**: Selects the optimal 2D position under constraints
- **Logging**: Full process logging with timestamped output

### Example Output

```

### Code Structure

The example consists of two files:

1. **`choice_primitives.py`** - Core library with:
   - `Choice` class for representing decision options
   - `ConstraintSet` class for defining and checking constraints
   - `UtilityFunctions` class with common utility functions

2. **`example_2d_optimization.py`** - Runnable demonstration showing:
   - How to create choices with 2D position options
   - How to apply bounding box constraints
   - How to optimize for maximum distance from origin
   - Complete logging and result presentation

### Using the Library in Your Code

```python
from choice_primitives import Choice, ConstraintSet, UtilityFunctions

# Define your 2D position options
positions = [(1, 1), (5, 5), (8, 2), (10, 10)]

# Create a choice
choice = Choice(positions)

# Add constraints (bounding box)
constraints = ConstraintSet()
constraints.add(ConstraintSet.bounding_box(0, 10, 0, 10))

# Filter and optimize
filtered = choice.filter(constraints.check)
optimal = filtered.optimize(UtilityFunctions.distance_from_origin)

print(f"Optimal position: {optimal}")
```

## Design Principles

- Choices are explicit, composable, and introspectable
- Constraints are first-class, with validation and explanation
- Utilities and preferences are pluggable and testable
- Support for uncertainty and stochastic outcomes

## Examples

### 1) Multi-objective decision with trade-offs

```python
from choice_primitives import Choice, ConstraintSet, Utility, solve

options = [
    {"name": "PlanA", "cost": 7, "impact": 0.6},
    {"name": "PlanB", "cost": 10, "impact": 0.8},
    {"name": "PlanC", "cost": 5, "impact": 0.4},
]

# Define utility with weighted objectives
weights = {"impact": 0.7, "cost": -0.3}
def u(opt):
    return weights["impact"] * opt["impact"] + weights["cost"] * opt["cost"]

c = Choice(options=options, constraints=ConstraintSet(["cost <= 10"]))
best = solve(c, utility=Utility(u))
```

### 2) Policy composition

```python
from choice_primitives import Policy

explore = Policy("explore", epsilon=0.1)
exploit = Policy("exploit")
composed = explore.then(exploit).repeat(10)
```

## Integration with Spiral Base

- Exposes solvers as transformations
- Validates constraints and utilities
- Composes with relation- and unit-primitives for grounded decisions

```python
from spiral_base import ModuleInterface
from choice_primitives import validators, solvers

class ChoiceModule(ModuleInterface):
    def register(self, system):
        system.add_validators(validators.all())
        system.add_transformations(solvers.all())
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Multi-objective optimization with Pareto front operations
- [ ] Stochastic decision processes (MDP, POMDP) interfaces
- [ ] Preference learning and elicitation tools
- [ ] Constraint explanation and conflict resolution
- [ ] Benchmark suite and example gallery

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from operations research, economics, AI/ML, HCI, and policy.

- Provide clear problem formulations and datasets (when relevant)
- Include solver performance notes and complexity discussion
- Add tests and small examples for each solver/primitive
- Document assumptions and failure modes

## Code Style and Testing

```python
from choice_primitives import Choice, solve

def test_choice_best_option():
    c = Choice(options=[1,2,3])
    best = solve(c, utility=lambda x: x)
    assert best == 3
```
